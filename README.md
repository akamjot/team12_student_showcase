### Project information 
<p>The purpose of our project is to design a website with student information. In terms of user interaction, users can click on the top navigation box to go to the information page they want to go to. And when you put the mouse on some photos or navigation, some movie effects will appear. In terms of animation, by scrolling the website page, you will find that the information on the website will gradually appear in different ways, perhaps from left to right, from right to left, or from bottom to top. Another small detail is that we added a progress bar at the top of the page. When you slide the page, you will find that the progress bar will change according to the progress of the web page you are reading.<p>
